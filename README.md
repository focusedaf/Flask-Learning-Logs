# Flask-Learning-Logs

Welcome to my first Flask application! This repository demonstrates basic Flask concepts such as route handling, URL parameters, and request handling. It is a part of my journey to learn Flask and backend web development.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the following basic concepts:
- Static Routes
- Dynamic Routes (URL Processors)
- Handling URL Parameters
- Handling Query Parameters

## Goals
- Understand basic Flask routing.
- Work with dynamic URLs and URL parameters.
- Learn how to handle query parameters in Flask.


## How to Use
Clone this repo and follow along with the code examples. Feel free to contribute or ask questions through issues.

### Installation
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flasklearninglogs.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd flasklearninglogs
  ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
  On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  On MacOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt yet, you can create it by running:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
 6. Run the Flask app:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
7. Access the app in your browser:
  Open your browser and go to ```bash http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ```
   to view the app.
  
  That's it! You're ready to start experimenting with Flask.

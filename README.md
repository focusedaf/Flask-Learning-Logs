# Flask-Learning-Logs

Welcome to my first Flask application! This repository demonstrates basic Flask concepts such as route handling, URL parameters, and request handling. It is a part of my journey to learn Flask and backend web development.

This repo showcases the following basic concepts:
- Static Routes
- Dynamic Routes (URL Processors)
- Handling URL Parameters
- Handling Query Parameters
- Templates
- Redirect Endpoints
- url_for()
- Filters

## Goals
- Build a solid foundation for developing more complex Flask applications    in the future.

# Flask-Learning-Logs

Welcome to my Flask learning journey! This repository is a collection of projects, tutorials, and experiments as I dive into Flask and backend web development. Each project here will document my progress and learning as I explore key Flask concepts and build web apps.

## Topics Covered
- Flask Basics: URL routing, GET/POST methods
- Templates and Static Files
- Form Handling
- Flask Extensions
- Database Integration (Future Plans)

## Goals
- Learn the core concepts of Flask
- Build full-stack applications with Flask
- Integrate Flask with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Get hands-on experience in backend development

## How to Use
Clone this repo and follow along with the code examples. Feel free to contribute or ask questions through issues.

### Installation
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flasklearninglogs.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd flasklearninglogs
  ```
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
  On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
  On MacOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt yet, you can create it by running:
  ```bash
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
 6. Run the Flask app:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
7. Access the app in your browser:
  Open your browser and go to ```bash http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ```
   to view the app.
  
  That's it! You're ready to start experimenting with Flask.
